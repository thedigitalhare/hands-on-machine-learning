## Why Machine Learning?

## Types of Machine Learning Systems

Here are the main categories of machine learning systems:

* Based on level of human supervision
  * Supervised
    * k-Nearest Neighbors
    * Linear Regression
    * Logistic Regression
    * Support Vector Machine (SVMs)
    * Decision Trees and Random Forests
    * Neural networks
  * Unsupervised
    * Clustering
      * k-Means
      * Hierarchical Maximization
      
  * Semisupervised
  * Reinforcement learning
* Based on ability to learn incrementally
  * Batch learning
  * Online learning
* Based on the way the system generalizes
  * Instance based
  * Model based
